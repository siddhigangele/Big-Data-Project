# Big-Data-Project

There have also been measurable impacts on the atmosphere from global climate change. Glaciers have shrunk, ice is breaking up faster on rivers and streams, plant and animal ranges have changed, and plants are blooming sooner.
There are now consequences that scientists have expected in the past would occur from global climate change: melting of sea ice, rapid increase of sea level and longer, more extreme heat waves.
This project focuses on doing predictive analysis about the weather based on weather dataset.  Different supervised learning Machine learning algorithms have been implemented using different software and big data tool such as Jupyter and Spark.
